# Time Series Forecasting

- time series forecasting.py : main code
- shdeshpa.csv : dataset used
- forecasting.pdf : report

## Implementation

- Checking for stationarity of data is done by performing logarithmic transformations, and first order differencing using Python.
- Post this, application of forecasting algorithms like Exponential Smoothing, Autoregressive (AR) model, is done on the temporal data. 
- A qualitative analysis on each of the models is done by calculating RMSE 

## Conclusion 

AR model performs the best on test data.
